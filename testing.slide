* Testing package

Testing your code is as important as writing it in the first place. Writing tests for the code is a good way to ensure quality and improve reliability. This article will highlight some of the Golang conventions which are followed while writing unit tests.

Go comes with a testing package which provides support for automated testing of Go packages. The command go test automates the execution of any test function which is found in “*_test.go” files corresponding to the package under test.
